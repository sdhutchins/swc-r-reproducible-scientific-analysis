## Gapminder Data Analysis

I'm learning about R for reproducible data analysis.


```{r load-data}
gapminder <- read.csv("../data/gapminder_data.csv")
summary(gapminder)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r life-expectancy, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  # extract first of country name into column
  mutate(startsWith = substr(country, 1, 1)) %>%
  # only keep countries that start with A & Z
  filter(startsWith %in% c("A", "Z")) %>%
  # plot life expectancy into facets
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = lifeExp,
             colour = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(country)) + 
  theme_minimal()
```
